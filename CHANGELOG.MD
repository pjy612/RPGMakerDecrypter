# Changed in this release

After a major architectural overhaul, I've decided to upgrade the RPG Maker Decrypter version to v3.0.0!

Biggest change in this release is the new and exiting support for the RPG Maker MV and MZ decryption. With this change, the RPG Maker Decrypter has become the only tool you will ever need to decrypt RPG Maker games made with any version.

With this change also becomes sad news for the fans of the GUI version. Because I do not have a personal Windows development environment anymore and thus am unable to update the Forms application, I've decided to drop its support. I removed the sources (including the experimental GTK UI), but they remain available in this [commit](https://github.com/uuksu/RPGMakerDecrypter/tree/1a24e8c0a9bbf7b9b1cb030a6a2eb20882e6df15). Maybe someone else would like to create a cross-platform UI (for example with Avalonia) or create a web service utilizing my code (that will be always FOSS with liberal license).

Application has also a new (not really) fancy icon!
